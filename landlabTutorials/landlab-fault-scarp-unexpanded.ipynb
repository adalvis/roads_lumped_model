    "This tutorial illustrates how you can use Landlab to construct a simple two-dimensional numerical model on a regular (raster) grid, using a simple forward-time, centered-space numerical scheme. The example is the erosional degradation of an earthquake fault scarp, and which evolves over time in response to the gradual downhill motion of soil. Here we use a simple \"geomorphic diffusion\" model for landform evolution, in which the downhill flow of soil is assumed to be proportional to the (downhill) gradient of the land surface multiplied by a transport coefficient.\n",
